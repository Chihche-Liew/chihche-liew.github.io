##### Abstract

Visuals in earnings-call decks can shape how investors read the numbers, yet they largely fall outside existing disclosure oversight. We compile 432,003 slides containing 153,331 charts from 2003–2023 and use transformer-based computer-vision models to detect five presentation features that can bias perception: missing Y-axes, truncated Y-axes, dual Y-axes, 3-D effects, and omitted data labels. These features are widespread—appearing in over half of calls—and are most common in nonfinancial disclosure slides. Usage varies systematically across firms: smaller and more profitable firms employ them more, while firms with greater stock-return volatility, stronger investor-relations oversight, or higher retail engagement employ them less. Event-study tests show that calls featuring such charts experience positive short-term abnormal returns that subsequently reverse, consistent with temporary investor misperception, an effect strongest for missing Y-axes in nonfinancial disclosures. Within-firm persistence suggests a stable presentation policy rather than isolated lapses. Our evidence positions slide design as an economically meaningful disclosure margin and highlights a regulatory blind spot: visual elements in corporate presentations merit scrutiny comparable to that applied to narrative and numerical disclosures.
