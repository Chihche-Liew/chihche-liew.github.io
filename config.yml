          subtitle: "Hi, I am a graduate student at UW-Madison, School of Computer, Data & Information Sciences and a researcher with a strong focus on empirical archival accounting, capital markets, and financial disclosure. I leverage deep learning, natural language processing, and high-performance computing to study issues such as supply chain risk, disclosure obfuscation, and return predictability. My research is driven by a desire to understand the economic consequences of information design and regulatory reporting in modern markets."
